# What is Computer Science?
It's a process of **solving problems**. Solving problem means: You've got some input and the goal is to get some output, the solution, to that particular problem. That process in between, called **algorithm** is where computer science comes in.

# Representation
So we now know that computer science is drawing output with input, but there left a question: how are we going to represent these inputs and outputs? How could it be possible for a computer to store not only numbers, but letters, images, videos, and sounds?    
We, humans, use **decimal**, which use ten(dec) digits, 0 to 9, to represent numbers. From the rightmost digit, we assign each digit to one's place, ten's place, hundred's place, and more on. And it turns out that these colums are just powers of 10: 10 to the 0 is 1, 10 to the 1 is 10, 10 to the 2 is 100. 123, for example, is 100 times 1, plus 10 times 2, plus 1 times 3.
